## SoFy Integration

When users browse the SoFy catalog for HCL software, they can easily build a custom *SoFy Solution* consisting of one or more software products from the catalog.  

In order for any HCL catalog entries to be installable and accessible from a *SoFy Solution*, the Helm chart needs to enable:

* SoFy Integration
  - [1. FlexNet License](/2021/07/14/03.1-sofy-integration-flexnet.html)
  - [2. SoFy Solution Routing](/2021/07/14/03.2-sofy-integration-soltn-routing.html)
  - [3. Global Configs](/2021/07/14/03.3-sofy-integration-global-configs.html)
  - [4. Solution Console UI Integration](/2021/07/14/03.4-sofy-integration-solutn-console-ui.html)
  - [5. Pods Requirements](/2021/07/14/03.5-sofy-integration-pods-requirements.html)
  - [6. Getting Sofy Domain in a Container](/2021/07/14/03.6-sofy-integration-getting-sofy-domain-name.html)
  - [7. Kubernetes Resource Naming Best Practice](/2021/07/14/03.7-sofy-integration-k8s-naming.html)

Teams that wish to use the same Helm chart for release channels outside of SoFy can hide the SoFy-required elements conditionally based on `.Values.global.sofySolutionContext` which is only set to `true` in SoFy solution charts.
