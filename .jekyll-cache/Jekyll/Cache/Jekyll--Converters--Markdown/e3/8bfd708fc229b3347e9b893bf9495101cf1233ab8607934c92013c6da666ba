<p>The SoFy catalog is comprised of five different types of content.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Products</li>
  <li>Modules</li>
  <li>Demo Packs</li>
  <li>Demo Docs</li>
  <li>Proxies</li>
</ul>

<p>Of these, Products, Modules, and Demo Packs can be deployed in either the standard full-featured mode, or in “Hybrid Mode,” which restricts some capabilities for non-HCL users.</p>

<h4 id="products">Products</h4>
<p>Products are actual HCL Software offerings, such as BigFix, Commerce, DX, and Domino.</p>

<h4 id="modules">Modules</h4>
<p>Modules are also called services, microservices, or APIs. These are helper components which generally work in conjunction with one or more products.</p>

<h4 id="demo-packs">Demo Packs</h4>
<p>Demo Packs are used to create demonstration environments where one or more products are integrated and configured for specific purposes. For instance, a Demo Pack for HCL Commerce might include additional database content, graphics, and integration with OneDB.</p>

<h4 id="demo-docs-and-proxies">Demo Docs and Proxies</h4>
<p>Some products, such as HCL Accelerate, include built-in demonstrations (and, therefore, don’t require a separate Demo Pack). Demo Docs are a way to provide detailed instructions on how those demos should be configured and presented.</p>

<p>Similarly, a few HCL products aren’t yet ready for inclusion in SoFy but have external web or demo sites. Proxy entries provide a way for those products to be included in the SoFy Catalog along with some level of documentation and links to their external sites.</p>

<h4 id="hybrid-mode">Hybrid Mode</h4>
<p>Hybrid entries are SoFy Products, Modules, or Demo Packs that can be deployed to a SoFy sandbox by anyone, but downloading of the Helm charts for deployment outside a SoFy sandbox is restricted to HCL internal users only.</p>
